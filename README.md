- run the command `python3 main.py` in the terminal
- the program will ask you to enter details about the user to generate a resume 
    or, alternatively it will take data from the variables.
- the program will generate a pdf file with the name `resume.pdf` in the same directory

## Note: 
The statements that will used to take user input are commented out in the code to avoid the input process because it will take too much time to enter the details manually. To test the program, you can uncomment the statements that take user input and run the program and you need to comment out the statements that assign the values to the variables manually.
